**Open File at Path** opens a palette into which you can type a file path and optionally line number and column number.
The palette will default to the first line of text from the clipboard.

This is especially useful when you have a file path in some stack trace or test failure but you can't click on it
because it's in a Report, or Nova doesn't recognize it because it has a line number and maybe a column number appended.

These are some valid paths:

- `src/hello.js`
- `src/hello.js:4`
- `src/hello.js:4:18`

To run Open File at Path:

- Optionally copy a path into the clipboard
- Select the **Extensions â†’ Open File at Path** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Open File at Path`
