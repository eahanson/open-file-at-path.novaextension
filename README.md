**Open File at Path** opens a palette into which you can type a file path and optionally line number and column number.

These are some valid paths:

- `src/hello.js`
- `src/hello.js:4`
- `src/hello.js:4:18`

The palette will default to the first line of text from the clipboard.

To run Open File at Path:

- Select the **Extensions â†’ Open File at Path** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Open File at Path`
